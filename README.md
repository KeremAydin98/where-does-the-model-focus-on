## Introduction

With the development of convolutional neural networks AI improved itself even better than humans in image classification. Convolutional layers learns how to differ the images by extracting features from low-level to high-level. But where does the model focus on before predicting the class of an image and is it the same as humans? That's why I built a model that generates the class activation maps of a given image so that we can see where the model focusses.

## Dataset 

The dataset contains images of 10 different fruits from kaggle:
